## R Markdown
Here we are going to learn a bit about penguins!

## Penguins
See below for averages on penguins. 

```{r penguins-ex, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

data("penguins")

penguins_island <- group_by(.data = penguins, island)
penguins_island_species <- filter(.data = penguins_island, species == "Gentoo")

summarize(
  .data = penguins_island_gentoo,
  avg_bill = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## Your work
Summarize the dataset in a meaningful way (use AT LEAST two of the key functions from slide #12)

```{r}

```

# Final task

You need to make a README.md doc -- practice by outputting a .md file here and renaming it to README.md before pushing to github
